As we slowly drove down the street on that cold December evening we spotted the porch light. "This must be the house." I told our "Positive Teens In Action" group. We pulled up in front of an older home with the porch light glowing. We gathered up our song books, walked up the steps, and knocked on the door. We heard a faint voice from inside say, “Come on in. The door is open." We opened the door.
在那个寒冷的12月份的夜晚我们开车在路上慢慢行驶时看到了门廊的灯光，我跟我们这个“积极行动的青年小队”说：“一定就是这家了。”我们把车停在一栋旧房子前，门廊灯光很亮。我们拿出歌集，走上台阶敲了敲门，听到里面传来一个虚弱的声音：“进来吧，门开着呢”，我们推开了门。

There in a rocking chair sat an elderly woman with a big smile on her face. "I've been expecting you." she said weakly. Ruth was one of our Meals On Wheels stops I had arranged; along with the usual church members who enjoyed carolers. We handed Ruth the basket of goodies the teens had assembled earlier that evening. Then I asked Ruth what carols she would like to hear. Ruth's face was beaming as she joined in singing each song.
摇椅上坐着一位老太太，脸上带着灿烂的笑容，她虚弱地说：“我一直盼着你们来。”Ruth的家是我安排的上门送餐服务的一站，和我们一起来的还有喜欢唱圣歌的常去教堂的人。我们递给Ruth一篮子美味的食物，都是我们这些年轻人那天晚上提前装好的。然后我问Ruth她想听什么圣诞颂歌，她跟着唱每首歌时脸上都洋溢着笑容。

As we hugged Ruth good-bye she said to me with tears glistening in her eyes, “The day you called I was still in bed. I had just finished praying. I asked God if it would be possible to have some Christmas Carolers come to my home and sing this year. Thank you for being the answer to my Christmas prayer."
我们跟Ruth拥抱说再见时，她眼睛里闪着泪光对我说：“你打电话那天我还躺在床上，刚刚做完祷告，我问上帝今年能否让唱圣诞颂歌的人来我家唱颂歌。感谢你使我梦想成真。”

Wow, what an awesome experience to have the opportunity to be the answer to someone's Christmas prayer.
哇哦，能使别人的祷告得以实现是多棒的一次经历呀。

Bible Text: When you pray, go to your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what you do in private, will reward you.
《圣经》原文：祈祷时要去房间里，关上门向无形的上帝祈祷，上帝看见你在秘密祈祷，就会回报给你。
